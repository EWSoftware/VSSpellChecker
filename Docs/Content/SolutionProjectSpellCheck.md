Selecting **Tools | Spell Checker** and choosing one of the solution or project spell check
options opens the solution/project spell checker tool window.  This tool window will only be usable when a
solution containing projects is loaded.


> [!NOTE]
> Solution/project spell checking only applies to non-source code files and only to strings and
> comments within source code files.  If enabled, identifier spell checking is handled by the code analyzer.
> Identifier misspellings are separate and will not appear in the Solution/Project Spell Check tool window.

There are two sides to the window.  The left side lets you choose what to spell check and shows
the results of the operation.  The right side contains the options to correct issues and will be updated to
reflect the current issue that is selected in the grid on the left side.
