		<introduction>
			<para>This category lets you define regular expressions that are used to exclude spans of text from the
spell checking process.  This is useful for excluding things such as common format specifier patterns in designer
code, CSS class name patterns, control name patterns, etc.</para>
		</introduction>

		<section>
			<content>
				<para>To add a new expressions, click the <ui>Add</ui> button.  A dialog box will appear in which you can
enter the expression and indicate which options if any should be used with it (Ignore Case, Multi-line, and/or
Single Line).  A comment can also be entered to describe the entry.  To edit an expression, select it in the list
and click the <ui>Edit</ui> button or double click it.  The same dialog box will appear in which you can modify
the expression settings.  To remove an expression, select it in the list and click the <ui>Remove</ui> button.</para>

				<para>For non-global settings, an option is available to inherit the exclusion expressions from
configurations above the current one.  If enabled, any additional expressions in the current configuration are
added to those.  If disabled, the settings in the current configuration will replace the inherited list of
exclusion expressions.  If not inherited and the list is left empty, it effectively clears the list of exclusion
expressions.</para>
				<!-- Ignore spelling: dd -->
				<para>The following are some common date/time format specifiers that may appear in designer code.  In
designer code, the format specifiers are typically not contained with braces and are thus included in the spell
checking process.  This can result in a large number of misspelling reports for non-words such as "dd" and "yyyy"
in format specifiers such as "MM/dd/yyyy".  By using one or more exclusion expressions to ignore such spans,
they can be removed and not reported.</para>

				<!-- Ignore Spelling: nn ss tt -->
				<code language="none" title="Example Exclusion Expressions">
					Various Date/Time Formats

					(d{1,2}, )?yyyy
					d{2,4},?\s{0,3}M{2,3}(/dd)?
					(d{1,2}[/\- ])?yy(yy)?
					d{3,4}( dd)?
					h{1,2}:(mm|nn)(:ss)?(.f{1,4})?( tt| AM/?PM)?  Options: Ignore Case
					M{2,4}[/\- ]d{1,2}
					M{2,4} yyyy
					yyyy-MM-dd

					GUIDs

					[{(]?[0-9A-F]{8}[-]?([0-9A-F]{4}[-]?){3}[0-9A-F]{12}[)}]?  Options: Ignore Case
				</code>

				<para>Another example is CSS class name or control ID patterns.  For example, adding the expression
<codeInline>btn[a-z\-]*?</codeInline> would prevent the ID and class names from being reported in the following
line of Razor code in an HTML file.</para>

				<!-- Ignore Spelling: btn -->
				<code language="html" title=" ">
					@Html.MyButton("Save", id: "btn-save", classes: "btn btn-default my-btn-class")
				</code>

				<alert class="tip">
					<para>It is possible that a large number of exclusion expressions may slow down the overall spell
checking process, especially for spell checking as you type.  It may be better to define expressions common to a
particular type of project within that project's solution or project spell checking configuration file rather
than putting all of them in the global configuration.</para>
