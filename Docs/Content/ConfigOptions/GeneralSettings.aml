				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para><ui>Spell check as you type</ui> - This enables and disables the spell checker.  Naturally, it
is enabled by default. The spell checker tool window relies on this being enabled.  If disabled, spell checking
will be unavailable until it is turned back on.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><ui>Include when performing solution/project spell checking</ui> - This option is available in
all configurations except the global configuration.  If set to Yes or Inherited (from the global configuration),
it will include the related files in the solution/project spell checking process.  If set to No, the related
files will be excluded from the process.  For example, this offers a convenient way of excluding an entire folder
of files from being spell checked as part of the solution/project as it does with the option above for
interactive spell checking.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><ui>Enable spell checking code analyzer in supported languages</ui> - This option enables the
spell checking code analyzer and is enabled by default.  It will spell check identifiers in all supported
languages (currently only C# but support for Visual Basic is planned for later).  Unlike comment and string
misspellings, identifier misspellings will be highlighted using the same colored underline as other code fixes.
Fixing a misspelling in an identifier will automatically correct it in all other references to it.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><ui>Detect doubled words</ui> - This will cause the spell checker to report instances of
doubled words.  An option to remove the duplicate word or ignore it will be offered as the options to correct
any instances that are found.  The default is enabled.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><ui>Ignore words with digits</ui> - This will cause the spell checker to ignore any words
containing digits.  The default is enabled.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><ui>Ignore words in all uppercase</ui> - This will cause the spell checker to ignore any words
consisting of all uppercase letters.  The default is enabled.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><ui>Ignore words in mixed case</ui> - This will cause the spell checker to ignore any words
consisting of mixed/camel case letters.  The default is enabled.  Note that if disabled, it may result in a large
number of false reports of misspellings especially on control prefixes such as <codeInline>btn</codeInline> and
<codeInline>txt</codeInline>.  These can be added as ignored words to suppress them.  Disabling this option may
also result in false reports of doubled words where the one of the words is part of a mixed case word preceded
or followed by another occurrence of the same word.</para>

						<para>Mixed case words that also include an underscore, period, or at sign will not be included for
spell checking even if this option is disabled based on the option related to the special word break character's
setting (treat underscores as separators is disabled, ignore words that look like filenames/e-mail addresses
is enabled)</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><ui>Ignore .NET and C-style format string specifiers</ui> - This will cause the spell checker
to skip text in .NET and C-style format specifiers (i.e. <codeInline>{0:MM/dd/yyyy}</codeInline> and
<codeInline>%ld</codeInline>).  This prevents the text within them from showing up as misspelled words.  The
default is enabled.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><ui>Ignore words that look like filenames and e-mail addresses</ui> - This will cause the spell
checker to ignore words that contain periods and at signs with no intervening whitespace (i.e.
<localUri>Userinfo.config</localUri> or <localUri>auser@mydomain.com</localUri>).  This option can occasionally
cause a misspelled word to be missed such as when a space is missing following the period in a sentence.
However, it excludes far more false reports and is enabled by default.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><ui>Ignore words that look like XML elements in spell checked text</ui> - This will cause the
spell checker to ignore words within angle brackets in spell checked text (i.e. "The <codeInline>&lt;para&gt;</codeInline>
element creates a paragraph").  This option can occasionally cause a misspelled word to be missed such as when a
space is missing following the opening angle bracket.  However, it excludes far more false reports and is enabled
by default.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><ui>Treat underscores as separators</ui> - This option is disabled by default and all words
containing underscores will be ignored.  Enabling this option will treat the underscore as a word separator and
each word separated by the underscores will be spell checked along with all the other text.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para><ui>Ignore mnemonics within words</ui> - This option is enabled by default.  It causes the
spell checker to ignore the mnemonic character (ampersand) within words being spell checked rather than treating
it as a word separator thus causing the text before and after it to be treated as separate words and possibly
reporting them as misspellings.</para>

						<para>If a misspelled word contains a mnemonic, it will be reported with the mnemonic and each
suggested replacement will have a matching mnemonic if it contains a matching letter.  This allows you to see
where the mnemonic is placed or if it will be lost in the replacement.</para>

			<title>Ignored Character Class</title>
			<content>
				<para>This option provides a simplistic way of ignoring non-English words containing specific classes of
characters.  It works best when spell checking English text in files containing Cyrillic or Asian text.  The
default is <ui>Include all words</ui> so that all words are included regardless of the characters they contain.
It can be set to <ui>Ignore words containing non-Latin characters</ui> to ignore words containing characters
above 0xFF or it can be set to <ui>Ignore words containing non-ASCII characters</ui> to ignore words containing
characters above 0x7F.</para>
