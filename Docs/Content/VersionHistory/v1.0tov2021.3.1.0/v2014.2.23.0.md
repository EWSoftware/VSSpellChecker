<!-- Ignore spelling: htmlx -->

Changes in this release:

- Fixed escape sequence checking to ignore `\x`, `\u`, and `\U` if not followed by valid hex digits.
- Added code to check for correct spellings when a word is followed by a period as some dictionaries do include
  them on words such as "etc.".
- Added handling of the "text" content type as a general catch-all for unknown derived content types implemented
  by third-party VSPackages.
- Added the "htmlx" content type to the HTML tagger so that files such as *.cshtml* files in Visual Studio 2013
  Razor projects are spell checked correctly.
- Added the option to import and export the user dictionary from the configuration dialog.
- Added support for Latin and Cyrillic dictionaries such as sr-Latn and sr-Cyrl.
- Dictionary filenames can now use language IDs with dashes or underscores separating the parts.
