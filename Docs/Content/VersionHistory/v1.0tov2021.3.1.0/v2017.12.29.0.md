Changes in this release:


- Fixed handling of Unicode apostrophes when removing "'s" to spell check the word without it.
- Added support for spell checking comments after an `#endregion` directive.
- Updated the word splitter and regular expression classifier so that they only merge two
consecutive string literals if they are of the same type (two verbatim string literals for example).
- Added default WPF text box exclusions for the Sandcastle Help File Builder WPF property pages
and form controls.
