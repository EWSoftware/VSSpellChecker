Changes in this release:


- Fixed loading of the default ignored words file in the absence of a default global configuration
file.
- Fixed loading of ignored words files so that words starting with an invalid escape sequence
have the leading backslash removed.
- Fixed saving words to the user dictionary file so that words added by other instances of Visual
Studio are not lost.
- Updated the word splitter to split text on emoji characters.  This prevents them from being
included as part of the preceding/following word and fixes a crash in NHunSpell that can occur if they are
included as part of the word when using non-US dictionaries.
- Added the menu option **Tools**, **Spell Checker**,
**Disable/Enable in Current Session** to temporarily disable and subsequently re-enable
interactive spell checking in editors during the current Visual Studio session.
