Changes in this release:


- Fixed some theme and font size issues.
- Fixed the C# tagger so that it does not include the `region` keyword
when spell checking the subsequent region description.
- When using the tool window, if a misspelling occurs within a collapsed region, the collapsed
region is now expanded to show the misspelling.
- Added support for importing code analysis dictionary settings for use in spell checking.  The
new [](@e01bd3d9-c525-4407-8c65-fcdb64539299) category options control how they are used.
