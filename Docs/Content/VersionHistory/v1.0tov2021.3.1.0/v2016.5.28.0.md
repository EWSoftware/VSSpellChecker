Changes in this release:

- Added support and configuration options for spell checking any WPF text box within Visual Studio.  See the
  [](@e23551ac-52f5-4505-b2d2-0728c7607fd3) topic for usage notes and for known issues and limitations.
- Added support for spell checking PHP files within the Visual Studio text editor when using the *PHP Tools for
  Visual Studio* extension.  Thanks to Miloslav Beňo of [DevSense](http://www.devsense.com/) for the tagger
  implementation.
- Made various adjustments to escape character checking.  It is now only performed in C-style language files.
  When doing solution/project spell checking, it is further limited to only check comments and normal string
  literals.
- Added support for installing the extension in Visual Studio 15 Preview 2.
