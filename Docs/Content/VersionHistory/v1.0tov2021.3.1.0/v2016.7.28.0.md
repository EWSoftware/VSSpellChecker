<!-- Ignore spelling: Kristensen -->

Changes in this release:

- Added \U201E (double low-9 quotation mark) as a work break character.
- Added support for spell checking markdown files within the Visual Studio text editor when using the
  [Markdown Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.MarkdownEditor) extension
  created by Mads Kristensen.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > You will need a Markdown Editor release later than 1.5.11 made after July 27, 2016 in order for spell
  > checking to have the proper effect on all parts of the markdown file's content.

- Updated the solution/project spell check to ignore certain pseudo-folders such as External
  Dependencies in C++ projects.
