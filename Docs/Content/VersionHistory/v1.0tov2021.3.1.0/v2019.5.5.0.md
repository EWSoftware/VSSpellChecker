Changes in this release:


- If no suggestions are found in the WPF text box spell checker, the Add to Dictionary and Ignore
Word options are now shown.
- Fixed the spell checker configuration editor and tool windows so that they use the Visual
Studio environment font and font size.  This allows them to scale based on the user's preferred Visual Studio
font and size rather than just with the system DPI settings.
