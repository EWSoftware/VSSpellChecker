Changes in this release:


- Fixed a bug with suggestions from code analysis files which don't specify a culture on the
suggestions.
- Added a new [](@b156d5ad-347f-4f63-89dc-4f945953ae41) category to the
configuration file editor to allow specifying an unrelated configuration file from which settings are imported.
- Added support for C# 8 verbatim interpolated strings (`@$"..."` versus
the current `$@"..."` format).
- Added support for retrieving filenames from JavaScript and TypeScript secondary buffers so that
they can be spell checked.
- Added support for asynchronous package loading in the VS2017 and Later version of
the package.
- Added support for installing the package in the upcoming Visual Studio 2019 preview.
