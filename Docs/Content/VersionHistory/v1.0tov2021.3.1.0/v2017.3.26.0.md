<!-- Ignore spelling: Kristensen -->

Changes in this release:

- Fixed the suggested action source so that it works properly with HTML files in Visual Studio 2017.
- Fixed the XML file classifier so that it doesn't miss comments between the start of the document and the root
  element when doing solution/project spell checking.
- Updated the word splitter to treat Unicode single quotes (\u2019) like ASCII single quotes (') for contractions
  to prevent false misspelling reports.
- Added support for *.editorconfig* files when using the
  [EditorConfig Language Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.EditorConfig)
  extension by Mads Kristensen so that it only spell checks the comments.
- Added "Ignore comments in XML files" and "Ignore comments in HTML files" options to the XML configuration
  settings category.  If enabled, they will ignore comments in XML and HTML files respectively when spell
  checking.
