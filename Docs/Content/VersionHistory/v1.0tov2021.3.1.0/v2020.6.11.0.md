<!-- Ignore Spelling: Miloslav Beňo -->

Changes in this release:


- Ensured that at least the default global ignored words file is included in the global
configuration when there is no saved configuration file.
- Fixed a crash in the solution/project spell check when an editor window does not have an
available text view.
- Merged change from Miloslav Beňo to prevent the HTML text tagger from classifying PHP
projection buffers (PHP Tools for Visual Studio).
