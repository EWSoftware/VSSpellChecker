Changes in this release:


- All dictionaries are now loaded asynchronously.  This helps prevent blocking Visual Studio when
large dictionaries or multiple dictionaries are loaded.
- Support has been added for an ignored words file as an alternative to managing ignored words.
This file can be specified in the [](@c592c4d8-7387-47fe-9b79-28bf0168f447) category of any
configuration file.  The global *IgnoredWords.dic* file will be used by default.  Words can be
added to ignored words files from the spelling suggestions context menu or from the spell checking tool windows.
- Fixed a bug in the handling of preprocessor keywords in the comment text tagger.
- Made a minor fix to the comment text tagger to include spans with a type name of "text".
- Added an option to spell check all open documents.
- Added `content` as a default spell checked attribute.
