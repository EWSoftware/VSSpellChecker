				<list class="bullet">
					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed the tool window so that it does not throw a "key not found" exception when the "Spell
check as you type" option is disabled.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed a bug in the C# tagger related to multi-line comments and strings which should prevent it
from leaving spelling tags in code when uncommented or not spell checking added lines under certain conditions.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Fixed the handling of user dictionary words so that they will show up as suggestions for
misspelled words rather than being treated solely as words to ignore.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added a new configuration category for <link xlink:href="c592c4d8-7387-47fe-9b79-28bf0168f447" />.
These are words such as Doxygen tags that start with what looks like an escape sequence or general words such as
programming terms or keywords.  For escaped words, it will ignore the escape sequence and the word rather than
just the escape sequence preventing the remainder of the word from showing up as a misspelling.  Ignored words
will not show up as spelling errors nor will they appear as suggestions for other misspelled words unless they
are in the selected language's dictionary.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added word breaking code to ignore .NET and C-style format string specifiers if so indicated by
the associated configuration option.  Note that it is enabled by default on new installations to ignore them but
if you have modified the configuration you will need to enable it manually in updated installations.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added support for doubled word detection and removal.  However, due to the way Visual Studio
breaks up spans of text for interactive spell checking, it will only be able to detect doubled words if they
appear on the same line.  Doubled words that span line breaks cannot be detected.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added support for disabling spell checking for files by filename extension.  Added a
<link xlink:href="b4a8726f-5bee-48a4-81a9-00b1be332607">new configuration option</link> to the configuration
dialog to allow setting the list of excluded extensions.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added a <link xlink:href="b4a8726f-5bee-48a4-81a9-00b1be332607">new configuration option</link>
to ignore words containing certain character classes (non-Latin or non-ASCII).  This provides a simplistic way of
ignoring some words in mixed language files.  It works best for spell checking English text in files that also
contain Cyrillic or Asian text.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Added a <link xlink:href="09cc5bfa-9eba-47e5-ba5f-a36e04f09b0d">C# Options</link> configuration
category used to disable spell checking of various C# source code elements.</para>
					</listItem>

					<!-- Ignore spelling: Ruhmann -->
					<listItem>
						<para>Merged changes from David Ruhmann to ignore Doxygen tags (escaped words) and enhance the word
breaking code.</para>
					</listItem>

					<listItem>
						<para>Updated the package icon and images with new ones supplied by David Ruhmann.</para>
