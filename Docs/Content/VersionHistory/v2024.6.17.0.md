Changes made in this release:


- Updated the tagger providers to use view taggers to support languages such as Visual Basic that
changed in Visual Studio 2022 (17.9.1) that now only classify the view and not the buffer.
- Fixed handling of ignored attribute values so that all parts are ignored if returned in
multiple spans of the same attribute value classification type.
