Changes made in this release:

- After 12 years, Microsoft decided that they don't like me using "Visual Studio" in the title of the extension
  and sent me a DMCA notice.  As such, I have had to change the name of the package and also update the logo to
  remove any implied association with their trademarks.  Henceforth, the title of the package will be "Spell
  Check My Code".
- Enabled installation in Visual Studio 2026.
