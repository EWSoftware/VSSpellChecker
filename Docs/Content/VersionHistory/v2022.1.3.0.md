Changes in this release:


- Added support for Visual Studio 2022 in July 2021.  Since it was the only change, no
help update was published for that release.
- Added *.tsx* as a recognized file extension for solution/project spell
checking.  Both it and *.jsx* files are now handled by their own parser that takes into
account HTML elements that may be embedded in the code for spell checking.  Because of the mix of code an HTML,
those two file types are now handled by the general tagger in the editor rather than the C# tagger.  As such, the
C-style configuration options are not applied to those file types anymore.
- Added a case to the general tagger to ignore the `text` classification
for Python files when the Python workload is installed.  When it is, the classifier for Python files flags many
elements as text even when they are not (variables etc.)
- Updated the HTML tagger so that it is used for Razor file content.
- Made several changes to the solution/project spell checking code to avoid responsiveness issues
in Visual Studio caused by garbage collections triggered by the code in prior releases.
