This dictionary was initially based on a subset of the
original English wordlist created by Kevin Atkinson for
Pspell and  Aspell and thus is covered by his original
LGPL licence.

It has been extensively updated by David Bartlett, Brian Kelk
and Andrew Brown:
- numerous Americanism have been removed;
- numerous American spellings have been corrected;
- missing words have been added;
- many errors have been corrected;
- compound hyphenated words have been added where appropriate.

Valuable inputs to this process were received from many other
people - far too numerous to name. Serious thanks to you all
for your greatly appreciated help.

This wordlist is intended to be a good representation of
current modern British English and thus it should be a good
basis for Commonwealth English in most countries of the world
outside North America.

The affix file has been created completely from scratch
by David Bartlett and Andrew Brown, based on the published
rules for MySpell and is also provided under the LGPL.

In creating the affix rules an attempt has been made to
reproduce the most general rules for English word
formation, rather than merely use it as a means to
compress the size of the dictionary. It is hoped that this
will facilitate future localisation to other variants of
English.

MARCO A.G.PINTO:
Since the dictionary hasn't been updated for many years,
I decided to fork it in order to add new words and fixes.

I even added words such as common names of software and hardware.

I grabbed Mozilla's version since it wasn't obfuscated. Alexandro Colorado and I
tried to unmunch the OpenOffice version but all we got was garbage.

The dictionary icon in the Extension Manager was designed by Pedro Marques.

The sources used to verify the spelling of the words I included in the dictionary:
1) Oxford Dictionaries;
2) Collins Dictionary;
3) Macmillan Dictionary;
4) Wiktionary (used with caution);
5) Wikipedia (used with caution);
6) Physical dictionaries

Main difficulties developing this dictionary:
1) Names of places and persons;
2) Words ending with 's;
3) Plurals.
