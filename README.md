This project is a Visual Studio editor extension that checks the spelling of comments, strings, and plain text
as you type or interactively with a tool window.  It also contains a code analyzer that will spell check
identifiers in C# source code.  It can spell check an entire solution, project, or selected items.  It is based
largely on the spell checker extension originally created by Noah Richards, Roman Golovin, and Michael
Lehenbauer.  This version has been extended significantly to include many new features all of which are
configurable.

_**NOTE: The master branch is for Visual Studio 2017 and later.  For Visual Studio 2013/2015, use the VSLegacy
branch.**_
