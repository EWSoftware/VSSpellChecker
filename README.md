This project is a Visual Studio editor extension that checks the spelling of comments, strings, and plain text
as you type or interactively with a tool window.  It is based largely on the spell checker extension originally
created by Noah Richards, Roman Golovin, and Michael Lehenbauer.  This version has been extended significantly to
include many new features all of which are configurable.

See the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/EWSoftware/VSSpellChecker/wiki) for information on requirements for
building the code, contributing to the project, and using and configuring the spell checker extension in Visual
Studio.
