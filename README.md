This project is a Visual Studio editor extension that checks the spelling of comments, strings, and plain text
as you type or interactively with a tool window.  It is based largely on the spell checker extension originally
created by Noah Richards, Roman Golovin, and Michael Lehenbauer.  This version has been extended significantly to
include many new features all of which are configurable.

_**NOTE: The master branch is for Visual Studio 2017 and later.  For Visual Studio 2013/2015, use the VSLegacy
branch.**_
